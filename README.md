```sql
CREATE DATABASE Movies_db;

### 2. Data Cleaning (SQL)

Performed multiple cleaning steps to make the dataset suitable for analysis:

| Task                    | Description                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| NULL handling           | Filled NULLs in runtime, rating, and popularity with average values.           |
| Removed invalid records | Deleted rows where release_date was NULL.                                      |
| Genre formatting        | Removed JSON-like text ([{"id":...}]) and cleaned it to show only genre names. |
| Added new column        | Extracted release_year from release_date for easier analysis.                  |
| Final clean table       | Created movies_clean for visualization and analysis.                           |

### 3. Analysis Queries (SQL)

Key analytical queries:

1. Top 10 Movies by Rating

```sql
SELECT title, rating
FROM movies_clean
ORDER BY rating DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

2. Top 10 Movies by Genre (e.g., Comedy)

```sql
SELECT title, rating
FROM movies_clean
WHERE genres LIKE '%Comedy%'
ORDER BY rating DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

3. Average Rating by Genre

```sql
SELECT genres, ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS avg_rating
FROM movies_clean
GROUP BY genres
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
```

4. Movies Released per Year

```sql
SELECT release_year, COUNT(*) AS movies_count
FROM movies_clean
GROUP BY release_year
ORDER BY release_year;
```
